Customer Segmentation for E-commerce Personalization

In this project, I am planning to build a customer segmentation system for an e-commerce platform using k-means clustering. 

Objective : 
          to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics, allowing the e-commerce platform to tailor marketing strategies and           provide personalized recommendations.
